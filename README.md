## Format

We will meet **every other Thursday at 16:00**. Each time we meet, one person will lead the session and will prepare a summary presentation about the assigned content. After the presentation, we will discuss the solutions to the assigned homework problems.

A Google Meet invitation will be circulated. If people are in the office and want to meet in person we can try to book a conference room to have a hybrid meeting.

Before the meeting everyone should:

1. Read the assigned book chapter.

2. Do the assigned homework problems (if any).

You may also consider watching the corresponding lectures for clarification or reinforcement. Note that the lectures may cover topics which may span more than one chapter.

The solutions to the excercises can be uploaded to this repo's [homework]() folder as an R script or an R Markdown document, so that people can see each other's approaches.

After the meeting the presenter can upload his/her slides to this repo's [presentations]() folder.

We can also use Issues in this repo to ask questions, discuss reading group logistics, etc.
