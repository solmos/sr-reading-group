## Format

We will meet **every other Thursday at 12:00**. Each time we meet, one person will lead the session and will prepare a summary presentation about the assigned content. After the presentation, we will discuss the solutions to the assigned homework problems.

A Google Meet invitation will be circulated. If people are in the office and want to meet in person we can try to book a conference room to have a hybrid meeting.

Before the meeting everyone should:

1. Watch the two assigned lectures.

2. Read the assigned book chapters.

3. Do the homework problems.

The solutions to the excercises can be uploaded to this repo's [homework]() folder as an R script or an R Markdown document, so that people can see each other's approaches.

After the meeting the presenter can upload his/her slides to this repo's [presentations]() folder.

We can also use Issues in this repo to ask questions, discuss reading group logistics, etc.
